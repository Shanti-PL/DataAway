                <p>
                    Dateaway is set out like an average dating simulator. Users will get a choice to take different characters with different interests and
                    personalities out on date. Throughout the conversation, users will learn more about Brisbane and
                    various public spaces. The NPC will promote certain locations that they are interested in so it is
                    beneficial for users to choose an NPC that fits their interests. To add to the game mechanics, users
                    have three lives to choose the correct answers to a series of choices throughout a playthrough.
                    Choosing incorrectly will cost them a life, choosing correctly will allow them to continue.

                </h2>

                <p>
                    The locations suggested to users are all from the government open datasets surrounding the public
                    spaces brief. Datasets such as park-locations, public art collections and events-active parks are the
                    main datasets that we used to introduce our users to an abundance of locations around Brisbane.
                    These datasets will be presented in the conversations with the NPC and on a displayed map.
